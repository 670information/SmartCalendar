1. a mail contains may contains multiple events 
currently, we don't use emails

2. Categories: seminar, movie, food 
wait to be adjusted

3. Given an arbitrary document, d, determine whether d contains information about an event in our categories,
   and if so, return an array of correctly-associated information about each event (date/time, location).
for calendar, the date/time and location are easy to extract

4. food-bot also uses calendar event 
actually, now it exclusively uses calendar

5. Source of event 
we need more calendar source

Data
1. only 2 food events
Now I add about 50 food events at UTaustin and CMU from food-bot.

2. the class of movies could be judged directly from the title
