	<title>Middle Eastern Film Club screens "The Color of Love"</title>
	<description>	
		Finding true love isn't easy for the youth of Iran. Nearly three decades ago, the country underwent a revolution intent on restoring traditional Islamic values. Today men and women are not permitted to
associate with the opposite sex in public. They risk being caught by the patrolling morality police, as illicit flirting, cruising and dating is punishable by law. In this engaging and surprising documentary, Iranians, young and old, married and single, speak candidly about love, marriage, and sex, revealing the truth about what it's like to seek and find love in modern Iran.

The movie is presented by Maryam Kashani.
