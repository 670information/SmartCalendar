Q&amp;A with director Ludi Boeken will follow the film.

Saviors in the Night (2011) is based on the best-selling memoirs of Holocaust survivor, Marga Spiegel. In 1965 Speigel published a narrative of her memories of the courageous farmers in MÃ¼nsterland, Germany who hid Spiegel and her family during Nazi occupation from 1943-1945. The Aschoff family provided protection and risked everything to protect their neighbors from deportation and certain death. Saviors in the Night honors these silent heroes by telling the story of survival and humanity.&lt;/div&gt;	</description>

Singing timeless classics from five decades of Barbra Streisand's multi-faceted career, Callaway crafts a loving musical portrait of the iconic diva. The Tony-nominated actress puts a unique spin on unforgettable songs from Barbra's Broadway years (Funny Girl) to her film works (A Star Is Born), from her early pop albums (People) to her later concept albums (Higher Ground), which debuted at No. 1 on Billboard and featured Ann's original peace anthem "At The Same Time." Callaway promises us a performance that not only celebrates the extraordinary career of Barbra Streisand, but also reminds us of "the way we were."

Mexican cinema 

Los Olvidados (1950) 
by Luis Buy?uel 

Monday October 1 2007 
7:30pm in CAL 100 
Sponsored by the GSO 

In his exile through Mexico, the father of surreal cinema, 
Luis BuyDC?uel (1900-1983), created one of the best motion-pictures in film 
history: the Mexican nonrealistic film entitled "Los olvidados" (The 
Forgotten Ones). The movie depicts the lives of two boys, surviving 
in the streets of a developing Mexico City. It is the story of the fatality of destiny, the absurdity, and irrationality of life itself. 

This 1950's film was recognized in Cannes as the best-directed movie, and is also in second place among the best 100 Mexican Films.

From the dark comedic mind of Mexican director Alejandro Lozano comes 
Matando Cabos (Noose Ends, 2004), a comedy that keeps you just where 
you should be: knowing everything but with no idea of what's going on

	<description>	
	Can we silence the ghosts of history? The Wehrmacht-Exhibition, which was shown in 11 major cities in Germany between 1999 and 2004 and was visited by more than 500,000 people, challenged ordinary Germans to rethink what their fathers and grandfathers did during the war. Whereas most had been led to believe that the cold-blooded murder of civilians had been a crime of a minority of officers, for the first time Germans saw photos and footage of ordinary soldiers executing civilians and POWs. The nation was shaken, and large protests were organized by those who believed the evidence was manufactured. In "The Unknown Soldier," director Michael Verhoeven interviews historians and experts, including those who allege or deny the crimes, and filmed in the killing fields of Ukraine and White Russia.
